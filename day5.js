 // a promise is an object that encapsulates 
 //the result of an asynchronous operation.


//  A promise object has a state that can be one of the following:

//  Pending
//  Fulfilled with a value
//  Rejected for a reason

//To get the value of a promise when itâ€™s fulfilled,
// you call the then() method of the promise object. 

//promise chaining
//you want to execute two or more related asynchronous operations, 
//where the next operation starts with the result from the previous step.

let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(10);
    }, 3 * 100);

    console.log(result);
    return result * 2;
}).then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    return result * 3;
});

//The Promise.all() method returns a single promise
// that resolves when all the input promises have been resolved.

//promise.race()- d accepts a list of promises as an iterable object and returns 
//a new promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as there is one promise that 
//fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

//Promise.any() returns a single promise 
//that resolves to a value which is the result of the fulfilled promise:

//Promise.allSettled() method that accepts a list of Promises and returns a new promise that 
//resolves after all the input promises have settled, either resolved or rejected.

// Promise finally() method to 
//execute the code once the promise is settled, regardless of its outcome.

//async code- setTimeout
//The await will wait for the Promise returned from the f() to settle. 
//You use the await keyword to wait for a Promise to settle 
//either in a resolved or rejected state

//when you nest many callback functions, the code will be more difficult to maintain.
